# Support for testing deployments to Payara 5
With this release, we add support to develop Dataverse further to be run
on the Payara 5 platform. This relates to IQSS/dataverse#4172 and many other
issues regarding moving from ancient Glassfish 4.1 to a recent platform.

[Documentation about usage with Payara](docs/payara.md) are included.

Changes to the Glassfish images:
- Moving `SECRETS_DIR` location to `/secrets` from `/opt/dataverse/secrets`.
  Ideally you will not see much differences when deploying via kubectl, as
  all deployment objects have been changed accordingly and will auto-update
  on your cluster.
